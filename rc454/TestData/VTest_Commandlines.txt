# The TestData folder should contain the following files, excluding this one:
VTest_reads.fa - example reads fasta of an HIV sample
VTest_reads.qual - example reads qualities
VTest_assembly.fa - example assembly made from these reads
VTest_genelist.txt - example genelist giving the position of each genes on the assembly
VTest_primers.txt - example list of primer location that were used for the sequencing of the data

# Path configuration for script location, muscle location, R location, etc.
# Modify any location that needs to be specified first in configfile.txt
# Run command line from the folder RC454_SoftwarePackage_201109

# folder, adjust paths accordingly if you moved them)

# First run Mosaik to create a raw read alignments. Note that this was tested with Mosaik version 1.1.0013,
# alignment results might be slightly different with another version

# Then run RC454 to clean-up the reads. The -bam option will create the sam/bam outputs, the -primers option specifies a primer list
# so that reads that started in these regions will be trimmed off in case this is primer sequence instead of real data, and the
# -genelist option specifies the list of genes so that the verification not to break reading frame only happens within the gene
# positions.

# You can test to see if qlxToSam.pl and samToQlx.pl are running properly running these tests to create
# the .qlx and .sam output from the other file that is produced by Mosaik. Note that while the .qlx file
# should be in all points identical to the one from Mosaik (so you can 'diff' the 2 files and obtain no difference), 
# the .sam file will be slightly different with one fewer header line and some extra details on each row. 
# The quality of each read alignment will also be set to 255
# The cigar string, read and quality sequences should all be identical however.
